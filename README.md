Graduate Level Class

This hands-on course offers an applied and practical introduction to exploring, visualizing and understanding ethical data concerns. Students use open source software to directly produce analysis, generate practical insights and characterize potential ethical data problems. Specific applications include using Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas and Numpy to manipulate data in Python (with a focus on graphical data representations). A core component of this course is its focus on ethical, moral and legal considerations when using data.
